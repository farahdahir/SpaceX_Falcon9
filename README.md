# **Space X  Falcon 9 First Stage Landing Prediction**
# Overview
This goal of this project was to create classification model to predict the successful landing of the Falcon 9 first stage. This prediction is of great significance because SpaceX's competitive advantage lies in the reusability of the first stage, resulting in significant cost savings compared to other providers in the space launch industry. The cost of a Falcon 9 launch, at $62 million, is notably lower than competitors' offerings, which can exceed $165 million per launch. By accurately determining whether the first stage will land successfully, we can estimate the cost of a launch. This cost information can be invaluable for potential competitors looking to bid against SpaceX for rocket launch contracts.
