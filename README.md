# **Space X  Falcon 9 First Stage Landing Prediction**
# Overview
The goal of this project was to analyze and predict the successful landing of the Falcon 9 first stage. By leveraging data from the SpaceX API, this project seeks to provide valuable insights into the factors influencing rocket landing success and develop a predictive model for future launches.

By accurately determining whether the first stage will land successfully, we can estimate the cost of a launch.

# Business Understanding
The cost of a Falcon 9 launch, at $62 million, is notably lower than competitors' offerings, which can exceed $165 million per launch. SpaceX's competitive advantage lies in the reusability of the first stage, resulting in significant cost savings compared to other providers in the space launch industry. This cost information can be invaluable for potential competitors looking to bid against SpaceX for rocket launch contracts.
