Sometimes a landing was attempted but failed due to an accident; for example, `True Ocean` means the mission outcome was successfully  landed to a specific region of the ocean while `False Ocean` means the mission outcome was unsuccessfully landed to a specific region of the ocean. `True RTLS` means the mission outcome was successfully  landed to a ground pad `False RTLS` means the mission outcome was unsuccessfully landed to a ground pad.`True ASDS` means the mission outcome was successfully landed on  a drone ship `False ASDS` means the mission outcome was unsuccessfully landed on a drone ship. \n",
